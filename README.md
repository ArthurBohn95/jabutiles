# jabutiles
A 2D Tile library for python.
Most of the backend is pillow (PIL fork), the rest is numpy.

With jabutiles you can:
- Load custom tilesets or create them proceduraly
- Do operations on them (rotate, mirror, scale, cut)


Tile shapes:
- orthogonal (square)
- isometric (diamond, WIP)
- hexagonal (both orientations, WIP)
